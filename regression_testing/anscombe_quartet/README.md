# Anscombe's Quartet experiments, by Steven Rouk

This directory in my "Practice" repo is dedicated to exploring the Anscombe's Quartet dataset.

See the accompanying write-up on Medium.com: [Beating Anscombe’s Quartet—Using data visualization and summary statistics to understand your data](https://medium.com/@stevenrouk/beating-anscombes-quartet-using-data-visualization-and-summary-statistics-to-understand-your-data-b2c709c244e9).

**Files**

* `helper.py` - This file has helper functions that I use in the Jupyter notebook to assist with plotting, modeling, and getting summary statistics.
* `Regression Experiments - Anscombe's Quartet.ipynb` - This is the Jupyter notebook walkthrough to accompany the Medium post. It doesn't have a lot of explanatory text, but it does show most of what's discussed in the article.
